## Description
Are you short on time to start from scratch to use deep learning to solve complex problems involving topics like neural networks and reinforcement learning? If yes, then this is the course to help you. This course is designed to help you to overcome various data science problems by using efficient deep learning models built in TensorFlow.The course begins with a quick introduction to TensorFlow essentials. Next, we start with deep neural networks for different problems and then explore the applications of Convolutional Neural Networks on two real datasets. If you’re facing time series problem then we will show you how to tackle it using RNN. We will also highlight how autoencoders can be used for efficient data representation. Lastly, we will take you through some of the important techniques to implement generative adversarial networks. All these modules are developed with step by step TensorFlow implementation with the help of real examples.By the end of the course you will be able to develop deep learning based solutions to any kind of problem you have, without any need to learn deep learning models from scratch, rather using tensorflow and it’s enormous power.
